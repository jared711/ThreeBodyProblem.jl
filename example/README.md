# Examples
This section of the repository contains helpful examples, both in Julia scripts and Jupyter notebooks. 
If you are brand new to the package, go through the examples in order to get a feel for how everything works.
There are still elements of the package that are not included in the examples.
Check out the documentation or the source code itself for more tips.
